## Hi there 👋

💼 I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the **Shaping Matter Lab** 🔬 at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering 🛩, TUDelft. 

🌞 My research area is mainly **computational mechanics**, and my interests lie around finite *element methods, structural optimization methods, fracture mechanics, metamaterials, and additive manufacturing*. However, I am also open to learning and delving deeper into a new area. 

☃ Apart from work, I like *cooking 🍳, movies 🎥 (irrespective of the language), poetry 🖋 and painting* 🎨. 

👻 I am very interested in chatting/collaborating with enthusiastic engineers🧑‍🏭/researchers🧑‍🔬/coders👨‍💻/painters👨‍🎨/cooks🧑‍🍳/movie-lovers🕵️‍♀️.  Feel free to contact me if you want to have a chat.
