## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in the Shaping Matter Lab at the Faculty of Aerospace Engineering, TUDelft. My research area is mainly computational mechanics, and my interests lie around finite element methods, structural optimization methods, fracture mechanics, metamaterials, and additive manufacturing. However, I am open to learning and delving deeper into a new area. I am very interested in collaborating with enthusiastic engineers/researchers/coders. Feel free to contact me.
